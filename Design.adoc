= Blox design

== Language

=== Variables
Variables are declared with `let`:

  let x = 1


=== Token streams
Use backticks for SQL queries:

  ```sql SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {userId} ```.execute(db)

=== String interpolation
To produce templated output, use backticks, and surround expressions with curly braces:

  html(`<h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>`)

=== Function calls
Use named arguments:
createUser(name: "Alice", age: 30)

== Web framework

=== Routing
File-based routing in `app/routes` directory.
Example: `app/routes/users/[id].blox` for `/users/123`

=== Context
Define shared objects in `app/context` files.
Import with: `import { database, logger } from context`

=== Form validation
Import validation module:
import { form, string, number } from "blox/validation"
let userForm = form(name: string().required(), age: number().min(18))
