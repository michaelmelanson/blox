= Blox design

== Language

=== Variables
When you need a variable in Blox, start with `let`. Your variables can't be changed after they're set, and Blox figures out their types automatically. Just remember to create them before you use them, and use a different name if you need another variable in the same area:

```
    let x = 1
    let name = "Alice"
    let active = true
    let scores = [10, 20, 30]
    let user = { name: "Bob", age: 25 }
```

=== Working with SQL
When you need to create database queries, use the query builder in `stdlib/database`:

```blox
import { select, table, to_sql } from "stdlib/database";

let users = table("users");
users
    .select(column: users.column(name: "name"))
    .where(column: users.column(name: "age").eq(value: 30))
    .to_sql();
```

TODO: The code to actually execute queries is not implemented yet.

All queries are automatically protected against SQL injection attacks through proper parameter escaping.

=== String interpolation
Need to insert values into text? It's easy! Just use backticks (`) and put your values inside curly braces {}. This works for any kind of text, whether it's HTML, messages, or file names:

```
  let greeting = `Hello, {user.name}!`
  html(`<h1>Welcome, {user.name}!</h1>`)
  log(`User {id} logged in at {time}`)
  let filename = `reports/{date}-{type}.csv`
```

=== Function calls
When calling functions in Blox, you must use named arguments to make your code clearer and easier to understand. It's not optional - every argument needs a name followed by a colon and the value:

```
createUser(name: "Alice", age: 30)
sendEmail(to: "bob@example.com", subject: "Hello", body: "Hi there!")
updateSettings(theme: "dark", notifications: true, fontSize: 14)
```

This makes it obvious what each value means and helps prevent mistakes from mixing up the order of arguments.

== Web framework
Blox was built to make web development feel natural and easy. If you've done any web development before, you'll feel right at home. Everything is organized in a way that just makes sense for building web applications - from routing to forms to data access.

=== Routing
In Blox, creating routes is as simple as adding files to your `app/routes` directory. Each file automatically becomes a route based on its path and name. Here's how it works:

- A file at `app/routes/about.blox` handles `/about` with GET
- A file at `app/routes/users.blox` handles GET `/users`
- A file at `app/routes/users/new.blox` handles GET `/users/new`
- A file at `app/routes/users/create.blox` handles POST `/users`
- For dynamic routes, use square brackets: `app/routes/users/[id].blox` handles paths like `/users/123`
- A file at `app/routes/users/[id]/edit.blox` handles GET `/users/123/edit`
- A file at `app/routes/users/[id]/update.blox` handles PUT `/users/123`
- A file at `app/routes/users/[id]/delete.blox` handles DELETE `/users/123`

The route's HTTP method is determined by the filename - `create` implies POST, `update` implies PUT, and so on. Regular files handle GET by default.

=== Context
Define shared objects in `app/context` files. Import with:
```
import { database, logger } from context
```

=== Form validation
Import validation module:
```
import { form, string, number } from "blox/validation"
let userForm = form(name: string().required(), age: number().min(18))
```
